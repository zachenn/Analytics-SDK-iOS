// MARK: - Automatic tracking

// use of load() deprecated in Swift 1.2 and initialize() deprecated in Swift 3.1 meaning we have to use a different method of swizzling
// both methods are automatically invoked by the Obj C runtime for each class
// swizzling should always be done in load()
// load() is called just before the application calls its first method on that class. it is guarnteed to be loaded during class initialization
// initialize() is called when it is messaged directly by the app (not guaranteed)

// here we can create our generic swizzle closure to be used

/* some areas to look out for:

- If the user overrides the method (ie viewWillAppear), then our swizzled method becomes invalid. in that regard, we have to make sure to call super.viewWillAppear
- we are calling our swizzed method within our swizzle function instead of the original method. not sure why, but it works, and calling the original method results in an infinite loop
